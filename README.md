# ToDo-List
Simple ToDo List API

This simple ToDo List API allows users to do the following:
 - Add Lists
 - Filter Lists by name
 - Get all Lists in the system, or get a list by id
 - Add Tasks to Lists
 - Set Task status to Complete

For the sake of this exercise an "in memory database" is used. 
The project includes basic unit tests using go test. 
Although not fully comprehensive, the unit tests test the basic functionality of the API
